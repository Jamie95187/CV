I am an enthusiastic, energetic full stack developer, with a strong passion in problem solving. My devotion towards finding solutions instinctively led me to engage myself in the world of coding. The limitless possible resolutions to a given project intrigues me.

My strong numerical background combines robust technical solutions which I love to integrate into my code. I am super passionate about writing readable, testable, adaptable code. I have recently finished a high intensity developer course at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/).

## Skills

- *Problem Solver* - I am very enthusiastic when it comes to solving any sort of problem. From being stuck on a route in bouldering to solving larger coding problems, I am eager to get my hands dirty and dive straight in. The fascinating design of any of the solutions and the multiple ways one can overcome them captivates my interest.
- *Superb Communicator* - In my previous roles I have learnt how to interact with different levels of management, from training new recruits at Royal Mail to reporting back to senior members at the warehouse. Vigorous pair programming exercises at Makers have taught me how to convey my ideas amongst a diverse cohort.
- *Excellent Team Player* - Strategised concepts in a team-based video game and maintained a cohesive unit to achieve national success. Consistently comfortable in finding my place in a team, whether that is following instructions from a leader or providing a leadership when the situation arises.
- *Highly adaptable* - I've always welcomed new environments, challenges, and coding languages. Engaging in dynamic settings at Makers has equipped me with skills that are transferable to any new team. Ranging from working with a very diverse set of students or solo on a given task.

- *Tech Skills*: Java, BlueJ, Eclipse, Android Studios, JUnit, Ruby, JavaScript, PSQL, React, Rails
